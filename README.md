# Bioinformatics
I have taken several college dealing with genetics a few years ago, but now I'm learning how to analyze genetic information. Most functions have been modified, but a few haven't really been changed other than formatting. I will try to distinguish my work from code that already existed. I am still in the process of explaining via comments within the code to better understand code I have written and haven't. That helps me, and might be able to help others at some point. 

## Why Have a Repo? 
I have Anaconda Navigator installed and do work on my laptop and desktop, so using version control with JupyterLab to push / pull changes enables me to keep everything I'm working on together. I'm finding Spyder, as a Python IDE, helpful for editing and testing the files and code. JupyterLab has better version control plugins than Spyder right now. So, I only use Spyder for editing and testing code. JupyterLab and Spyder came preinstalled (I think?) with Anaconda Navigator.
